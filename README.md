# OpenVaccine-COVID-19-mRNA
OpenVaccine: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction Kaggle Competition

Winning the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic will require an effective vaccine that can be equitably and widely distributed. Building upon decades of research has allowed scientists to accelerate the search for a vaccine against COVID-19, but every day that goes by without a vaccine has enormous costs for the world nonetheless. We need new, fresh ideas from all corners of the world.

In this competition, we are looking to leverage the data science expertise of the Kaggle community to develop models and design rules for RNA degradation. Your model will predict likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule, trained on a subset of an Eterna dataset comprising over 3000 RNA molecules (which span a panoply of sequences and structures) and their degradation rates at each position. We will then score your models on a second generation of RNA sequences that have just been devised by Eterna players for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. These final test sequences are currently being synthesized and experimentally characterized at Stanford University in parallel to your modeling efforts -- Nature will score your models!
